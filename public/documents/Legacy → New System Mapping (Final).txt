# Legacy → New System Mapping (Final)

**Faculty Management System (FMS)**  
**Milestone 1 – Planning & Design**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document maps the data fields, modules, and workflows from the **existing legacy system** to the **new Faculty Management System (FMS)**. It ensures clear traceability of features, reduces data migration errors, and guides the development and ERD design process.

## 3. Notes

1. **Normalization:** All previously unstructured text fields are converted into normalized tables to enable reporting and version tracking.
2. **Versioning:** Publications, profile updates, and experiences maintain full version history with rollback capability.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Mapping considers multiple roles per user and admin approval requirements.
4. **ERP Integration:** Data mapping includes a placeholder for Phase-2 ERP API fields.
5. **Public vs Internal Data:** Only verified teachers’ information is publicly viewable; student or unknown contributor data is stored internally for reference.
