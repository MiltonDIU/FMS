# Faculty Management System (FMS)

## Software Requirements Specification - SRS (Final)

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements of the **Faculty Management System (FMS)**. The document serves as a single source of truth for university management, stakeholders, designers, and developers to understand *what the system must do*, *what it will not do*, and *how it should behave*.

This SRS is written to support **phased approval and development**, where **Phase-1 (Core Faculty Profile Management)** is fully independent, and later phases may be approved or deferred without impacting the usability of Phase-1.

### 1.2 Intended Audience

* University Management
* Registrar Office
* IT & Development Team
* Quality Assurance Team
* External Vendors (if any)

### 1.3 Scope of the System

The Faculty Management System (FMS) is a centralized digital platform for managing faculty profiles, academic records, administrative roles, and public faculty information through a **self-service, approval-based, and version-controlled** workflow.

---

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 System Overview

FMS replaces manual, document-based faculty profile handling with a structured web-based system where:

* Teachers manage their own profiles
* All changes follow a review and approval workflow
* Only approved data is publicly visible
* Administrative roles are tracked independently from academic designations
* The system supports future ERP and research publication integrations

### 2.2 User Classes and Roles

| Role                | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Super Admin         | Full system access, configuration, and oversight |
| Admin               | Manages users, approvals, and system data        |
| Registrar Office    | Verifies and approves faculty data               |
| Teacher             | Manages own profile and views personal dashboard |
| IT User (Developer) | Technical maintenance and support                |

> A single user may hold **multiple roles simultaneously**.

### 2.3 Operating Environment

* Web-based application
* Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
* Backend: API-driven architecture
* Database-driven, normalized schema

---

## 5. Phase-3 Functional Requirements (Optional – Research & Publications)

**FR-29:** Research Team users shall manage centralized publication entries.

**FR-30:** Publications shall be linked to existing teacher profiles automatically.

**FR-31:** Unknown authors shall be verified via ERP lookup.
