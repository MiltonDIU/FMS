# Faculty Management System (FMS) 

## Project Objectives & Scope Document - (Final)

---

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the **objectives, scope, and phased vision** of the proposed **Faculty Management System (FMS)** for **Daffodil International University (DIU)**. The purpose of this project is to modernize the existing faculty profile management process by introducing a **self-service, approval-based, version-controlled, and scalable digital platform**.

The document is aligned with the **latest approved Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** and is structured to support **phased approval**, allowing the university to implement core faculty profile management independently, while keeping advanced automation and research integrations optional.

---

## 2. Background & Current Challenges (As-Is System)

The existing faculty profile management process primarily depends on **department-level accounts**, where teacher information is manually collected through **PDF/DOC files** and entered by department users, Registrar Office staff, or administrators.

### Key Challenges

* Teachers cannot update their own profiles
* Heavy dependency on Registrar Office and Admin for manual data entry
* Academic data stored as unstructured text (tables/paragraphs)
* No statistics on publications, experience, or research output
* No version history or rollback capability
* Outdated UI/UX
* Public profiles become outdated quickly
* No ERP-driven onboarding or automation

---

## 3. Proposed Solution (To-Be System)

The proposed FMS introduces a **teacher self-service model** combined with **institutional governance through approval workflows**.

### Core Principles

* Teachers manage and update their own profiles
* All changes are saved as **draft versions**
* Only **approved versions** are published publicly
* Complete **version history** with rollback support
* Clear separation of **academic designation** and **administrative roles**
* Administrative roles automatically generate experience history
* Role-based dashboards and statistics

---

## 4. Project Objectives

### 4.1 Primary Objectives

* Enable teacher self-service profile management
* Reduce manual workload of Registrar Office and Admin
* Introduce approval-based publishing for data accuracy
* Maintain full version history with rollback capability
* Transform unstructured academic data into structured, reportable formats
* Support multiple concurrent roles per user
* Automatically record administrative responsibilities as experience
* Provide role-based dashboards and analytics
* Modernize UI/UX for administrative and public users

### 4.2 Secondary Objectives

* Enable faculty- and department-level statistics
* Improve accreditation and audit readiness
* Establish a centralized faculty data repository
* Ensure long-term scalability and extensibility

---

## 5. Scope of the Project

### 5.1 In Scope (Phase-1: Core Faculty Profile Management)

* Teacher self-service profile editing
* Structured academic and professional data modules
* Approval workflow with **Registrar Office as final authority**
* Draft, approval, rejection, and publish lifecycle
* Profile versioning and rollback
* Faculty → Department → Teacher hierarchy
* Academic designation management
* Administrative role management (Dean, Head, Coordinator, Acting roles)
* Automatic experience timeline generation from role lifecycle
* Role-based dashboards and statistics
* Public faculty profile portal

> **Phase-1 is fully functional and independent. Approval of Phase-1 alone enables complete faculty profile management.**

---

### 5.2 Optional Enhancements (Future-Ready, Not Mandatory for Phase-1)

The system architecture will support the following enhancements without impacting Phase-1 stability.

#### 5.2.1 Advanced Approval Workflow (Future)

* Multi-office approval routing (HR, Research Team, Registrar)
* Approval flow configurable by Super Admin
* Registrar Office remains default final authority unless changed by policy

---

## 6. Phase-2 Scope: ERP-Based Profile Automation (Optional)

Phase-2 focuses on **reducing manual data entry** through ERP integration. This phase is dependent on ERP system readiness and approval.

### Objectives

* Search faculty records using Employee ID
* Fetch verified core teacher information from ERP
* Automatically create faculty profiles
* Reduce duplicate data entry and human error

> Phase-2 may be approved independently and does not affect Phase-1 usability.

---

## 7. Phase-3 Scope: Research & Publication Alignment (Optional)

Phase-3 aligns faculty profiles with institutional research and publication management.

### Objectives

* Centralized publication entry by Research Team
* Automatic linking of publications to faculty profiles
* ERP-based author identity verification
* Support for non-teacher contributors (backend only)
* Eliminate duplicate publication data entry across systems
* Provide research dashboards and statistics

> Public profiles will display publications **only for verified teachers**.

---

## 8. Out of Scope

* Payroll and financial systems
* Attendance and leave management
* Student academic records
* Performance appraisal systems

---

## 9. Key Benefits

* Significant reduction in administrative workload
* Improved accuracy and consistency of faculty data
* Structured, analytics-ready information
* Transparent approval and audit trails
* Enhanced public visibility of faculty achievements
* Modular, future-proof system design

---

## 10. Conclusion

The Faculty Management System is designed as a **governance-driven, scalable, and faculty-centric platform**. By separating core profile management from optional ERP and research integrations, the university gains flexibility in approval, reduced implementation risk, and immediate operational benefits.
